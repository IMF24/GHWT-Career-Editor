The GHWT Career Editor is a very basic program that constructs a script mod for Guitar Hero World Tour: Definitive Edition that allows for you to create custom careers! In order to make the most use of this program, it helps to know a bit about it.

Please remember that many coders hate documenting, so it is greatly appreciated if you take the time to read through this. :)

In a nutshell, this program is split into 2 different editing modes: the Tier Progression Editor, and the QB Script Editor. The former is the recommended mode for most users who want results fast or do not feel comfortable in script modding. The latter can be good for those who are more experienced with script modding and want to edit the nitty gritty details themselves. Whichever mode you elect to use will still work!

Tier Progression Editor

The Tier Progression Editor is the graphical editor for the gigs in Career Mode. It isn't hard to use; to add a tier to the list, either click on "Add New Tier" in the main editing pane or, in the top menus, go to Add > New Tier. You can also press the Control and T keys at the same time to add a new tier to the list.

When the new tier is added, you will see it show up in the editor. Here's what you will see added:
- There will be a venue selector where you can choose which venue you want the gig to take place in. In addition to setting the venue, it will also determine the poster on the wall.
- To add songs to the gig, select the "Add Song" button on the right.
- To delete the tier, select "Delete Tier".

When you create new songs for the tier, it will show up below the tier's venue. There will be an entry field to type out a checksum for the song that you add to the gig. If you don't know of the checksum, you can press the triple dot button ("..."), and you can select a song.ini file from one of your installed song mods in GHWT: DE. Upon selecting the INI file, it will populate the respective entry box with the checksum of that song.

If you need to delete a song out of the tier, press the "X" button to the right of the triple dot ("...") button.

Essentially, repeat this process for as many gigs as you want! It should be noted, however, that if your created career progression exceeds 18 gigs, all gigs following the 18th gig will be ignored. There isn't enough room in-game for them!

Exporting the Script Mod
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
So now, you've done it. You've made your career progression modifications, and now you want to save and test them in-game. How do we do that?

To export and let others play your career mod, all you have to do is go to File > Export Script Mod... OR press the Control and E keys together, and the Export Script Mod dialog box will open.

When the dialog opens, you'll see a few different options for what you can do with the exported mod. We'll run through them:
> SDK Path: The path to where you have the Guitar Hero SDK installed. If you want the program to export your career progression to a QB script mod, you'll need to provide this. This also means that you need to have Node.js installed; neither the exporter or SDK will function without Node.js installed!
> Debug Message: This is a message printed to the "debug.txt" file when the mod is loaded by the modding API used by World Tour Definitive Edition.

The next 4 settings are for the Mod.ini file:
- Mod Name: The name of the mod itself.
- Mod Author: The author of the mod. This will probably be your name!
- Mod Description: A brief (or detailed!) description about your mod.
- Mod Version: The version of the mod. Probably 1.0!

Note that you can leave these blank if you don't want to fill them out immediately. The program will fill these in automatically if they're blank!

Lastly, there is a setting to tell the program what the file name should be. You can also pick if the mod will be exported as a QB file (.qb.xen) or a text document file (.txt). If the latter is selected, it will not convert the mod into a QB script, and it will also not create a Mod.ini file.

When everything looks good, click on "Export Script Mod"! If everything went well, you should see a dialog box appear telling you that it performed everything it needed to do successfully. It will open a folder in the same directory that the program is running in, and inside of it, you'll find the files in generated by the program there! The name of the folder is the same name that you gave the script mod QB or TXT file.

At this point, you can now drop the mod folder into the DATA\MODS folder of your GHWT installation folder, and test it out in-game!
