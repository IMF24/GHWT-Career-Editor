Is the vanilla guitar career becoming a bore? Do you wish you could spice it up and use songs from custom setlists or just other random customs you have? The GHWT Career Editor (GHWTCE) is probably your answer! GHWTCE is a small little program that lets you create your own custom guitar careers for use in Guitar Hero World Tour: Definitive Edition. It will automatically create a script mod with the necessary files to make it work in-game; you don't need to anything more than dropping the script mod into your MODS folder!

GHWTCE is still in development, but most of its initially planned features are currently working!

Here are the things still in the works:
- QB Script Editor is still blank
- No working preview pane yet
- Status bar doesn't have any use yet
